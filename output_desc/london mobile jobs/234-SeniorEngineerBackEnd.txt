Since August last year, they have helped investors deploy over $17m, whilst in private beta, growing 30% month on month. They are now hiring aggressively to build the best angel investment platform in Europe.

üîç Focus

We are an investment platform, dealing with people‚Äôs money. Details matter a lot. This means we rarely make mistakes that upset our customers, and we don‚Äôt ship things that aren‚Äôt our best work.

üí∏ Disagree and commit
We promote a culture of open feedback and challenging things we disagree with, after taking time to understand why someone has suggested something. The important thing is to know how to disagree and commit, so we‚Äôre all pushing in the same direction at the end of the day.

üí® Ownership

If you think there‚Äôs something wrong, suggest a solution and be proactive about fixing it. As long as you‚Äôre communicating with the rest of the team, we want you to feel empowered to have an impact.

üé§ Transparency

Always speak up. Offer and ask for help and feedback. We value honest feedback delivered with kindness, and we value people who ask questions. If you don't understand something, or think something could be done better, tell your team.

üíú Kindness

Never lose sight of your instincts. We hired you because we think your heart is in the right place. Prioritise doing what is ethical and just, and put this ahead of what is most profitable or easiest - whether you're dealing with a colleague or a customer.

‚è± Work hard and enjoy the journey
