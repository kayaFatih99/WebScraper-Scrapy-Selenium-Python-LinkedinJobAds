Role: Senior Back End developer/Team Lead

Duration: 12 months + extension
Salary Range: 650-700 euros per day
Start Date: ASAP

I am looking for experienced Developers wanting to relocate to Amsterdam and make use of the NL's 30% tax deduction for skilled tech professionals and work on a hugely exciting project.

My client is a large tech incubator looking for a team lead with backend skills and the ability to make good decisions on front end as well. You should have at least 5 years of Developer experience and be confident in Go/Node.JS.

You would be helping to scope out a large project with a small yet dynamic team and your initial contract would be for 12 months, starting as soon as possible. You will be working directly with the Project Lead and this job does have an element of occasional international travel.

We have worked for this client for 4 years and most of our placements choose to extend their contracts or go perm, it really is an exciting project. Our client is happy to assist in payroll and admin matters relating to re-locating and this can be achieved very fast.

Please get in touch (as soon as possible!) with liberty.blackmore@talentinternational.com for more details!
