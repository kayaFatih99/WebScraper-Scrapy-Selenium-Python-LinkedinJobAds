About the job
Location: Remote First in Europe (GMT+/-2) with WeWork access and London HQ
Salary: Â£60-85k + stock options + bonus

Everyday an unsuspecting colleague, friend, or family member is targeted by criminals. In the United Kingdom, 4.6 million people are affected by fraud annually, and around 700,000 will suffer profoundly as a result. Globally, the problem is even worse.

CybSafe is a venture-backed startup working to prevent people falling victim to cyber incidents for organisations of all sizes.

We're on a mission to revolutionise the way society addresses the human aspect of cyber security. We believe security awareness shouldn't be a tick in the box exercise, and organisations of all sizes should benefit from data science and behaviour change theory.

We're building an intelligent behavioural security platform to combat the rise of sophisticated scams, fraud, and malicious hacking. We're using the power of science, data and behaviour change theory to create a safer and better digital world for everyone.

We're a tribe of risk-takers, game-changers, free-thinkers and doers. And we're passionate about the impact we have on our planet through our software and our voices.

Passion. Impact. Transparency. Autonomy. Purpose. Diversity. Belonging. If these resonate with you, come join us and make a difference.
