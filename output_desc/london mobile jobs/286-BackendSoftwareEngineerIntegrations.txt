Who are Yapily and what do we do?


Yapily is an open banking platform solving a fundamental problem that exists within financial services today: access. For years, card networks have monopolised the global movement of money, and banks have monopolised the ownership of, and access to, financial data. Yapily was founded to challenge these structures and create a global open economy that works for everyone.


Yapily securely connects companies to thousands of banks, enabling them to access data, initiate payments, and embed the power of open banking into their products and services. 100% focused on building infrastructure and tools instead of apps at the product layer, Yapily is a true technology enabler allowing its customers' products to take centre stage.


Yapily's customers range from disruptive fintechs to big banks and financial institutions across Europe, operating in a number of verticals including Payments, Lending, and Accounting and Bookkeeping.


Yapily has raised $69.4M in funding to date, employs over 200 people worldwide, and continues to grow across Europe. Check us out on LinkedIn and Twitter to see what we've been up to lately.


What's in it for you?

A competitive salary in a rapidly growing scale-up
Uncapped commission - you are in control of your earnings!
25 days holiday (UK)
Generous level of stock options
Private healthcare
Pension with employer contribution
Career trajectory: we hire Yapsters to grow them within the business
