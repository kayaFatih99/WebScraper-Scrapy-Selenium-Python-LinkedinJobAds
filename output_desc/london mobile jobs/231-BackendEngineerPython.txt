About the job
Here at FIXR we’re on a mission to be the number one ticketing platform globally. Ticket sales and event management can typically be a clunky, manual process, but our platform makes it easier than ever for event organisers to create seamless, user-friendly experiences for their customers.

We kickstarted our journey in 2015, and since then we’ve helped millions of people enjoy events all over the UK; whatever size or type of event, we provide a comprehensive end-to-end solution for event organisers, allowing them to not just sell tickets, but to track sales performance, craft a seamless customer journey, and build a valuable and compliant dataset. While we’ve been a leading ticketing platform in the student events industry since our inception, we’ve seen explosive growth across wider industry areas, and we’ve now got exciting plans to expand into new verticals by building out some brand-new features and taking our offering global.
