About the job
This is a unique opportunity for an engineer.

You'll be building a product for you and your peers.

The client is one you use every day. Not the browser or your phone, but your code editor.

And the backend combines an API gateway to issue trackers with business logic.

This presents a very interesting set of challenges. We need your help to tackle them and grow our product now that we've found product-market fit.

Your responsibilities

Your goal is to lead the development of our third party integrations.

You'll start by focusing on issue trackers. We need to integrate with all major providers. And there are lots of them, so you'll have your work cut out.

Providing a consistent user experience across all these issue trackers without development costs scaling superlinearly is a major challenge. One you'll be responsible for solving.

That's just the beginning. Stepsize will become the central tool to plan and manage technical work.

We'll also integrate with:
Code review tools (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
Communication tools (Slack, MS Teams, etc.)
Application performance monitoring tools (New Relic, Datadog, etc.)
Code quality tools (Code Climate, CodeScene)

We'll want the community to build some of these integrations for us. You'll have to create our own public API to make that possible.
