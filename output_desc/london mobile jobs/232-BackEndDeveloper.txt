About the job
As a Back-End Developer, you'll spend most of your time building and maintaining robust GraphQL APIs and providing clients with multiple data-rich views into operational risk management.

You’ll need to decide between extending existing functionality or breaking things out into more re-usable patterns, whilst being mindful about consistency, reusability, and looking for ways to make developers lives easier.

As part of the role, you will be involved in the full Agile lifecycle including feasibility of features, discussing how to implement them, and providing constructive feedback in our regular retrospectives.

Our tech stack is one of the best around. You'll be using Node.js, TypeScript, GraphQL (with Apollo Federation), Azure Serverless and, of course, Git!

When it comes to hardware, you’ll be given the choice of a MacBook or Windows laptop, along with anything you need for a comfortable and productive remote working environment.
