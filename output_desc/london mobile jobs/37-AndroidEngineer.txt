About the job
Starling engineers love building things, creating new stuff, learning new technologies and working with others across all areas of the business to bring brilliant products and features to life. We enjoy working with engineers who are excited about helping us deliver new features, regardless of what their primary tech stack may be. Hear from our engineers in our latest blogs or our case studies with Women in Tech.



Our mobile engineers work in cross-functional feature teams arranged across broader engineering groups. You are empowered to make the decisions necessary for the platform and to provide insight to the team leads on such projects. You'll also be working closely with other Android engineers with a variety of experience levels and interests, helping us improve and develop our Android app, CI automations and tooling. You'll be committing, reviewing and shipping new code right from the first week! ðŸŽ‰


In the Starling Android application we are proud to be working with some of the latest technologies in the industry. When adopting new technologies we always consider as a team whether it's the best choice for our product and our users. We have a strong collaborative and open culture here so you'll find support outside your team too.


Requirements:

As a fully digital bank, we are looking for engineers that are able to understand and prioritise security when implementing new features, fixing bugs or making technical improvements, across all the layers. Our team is designing, building and releasing new screens every day, for this reason we are interested in people with a particular focus on Accessibility along with writing clean and maintainable code.


The way to thrive and shine within Starling is to be a self-driven individual and be able to take full ownership of everything around you: From building the code, shipping and maintaining it, to sharing knowledge with your colleagues and making sure all processes are efficient and productive to deliver the best possible results for our customers.


Our aim is to deliver stable, resilient and high quality code, that is why testing is another key quality we look for when expanding our team. We use Espresso to write our UI/E2E Test and JUnit to write our Unit Tests across all layers of the application, as well as manually test all features before they go into production. We also work closely with QA engineers to ensure we have an additional level of testing when working on complex feature delivery.
