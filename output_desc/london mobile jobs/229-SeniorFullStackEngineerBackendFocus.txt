Why should you care about this role? 🤷

We’re creating something amazing. The collaboration experience has been held back for decades, and we’re finally here to change that. Be a part of fundamentally re-inventing what it means to work remotely.
We’re building a tight-knit, world-class team. We invest a lot of energy into getting the cultural fit right, to build a high-performing team that enjoys what they do.
A place where you can bring your ideas and preferences. We’re early in the process and you have the power to really make a difference here.
We care about craftsmanship. We pay attention to the details and seek inspiration everywhere. Get the freedom and breathing room to do your best work.
We're remote first. Feel free to live anywhere in the UTC±4h timezone. We always try to make life easy for you. We only do meetings when they're really needed so that you can stay in flow.
We are backed by the investors behind Revolut and Hopin. We can count on a pool of investors that have built and played instrumental roles in iconic companies, including Figma, Microsoft, Flexport, Square and more.
