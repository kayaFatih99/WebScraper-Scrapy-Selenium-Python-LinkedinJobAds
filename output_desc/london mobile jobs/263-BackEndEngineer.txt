How do we work?
All our services are built-in Ruby, Elixir or Typescript, depending on which language best suits the solution
For communication we use Kafka for events and gRPC or JSON for synchronous calls.
All our services run in Kubernetes.
We are in the process of switching away from our Ruby monolith to a brand new microservice architecture.
Domain driven design is at the heart of our development process, we like to build fast but think about the bounded context before we start.
