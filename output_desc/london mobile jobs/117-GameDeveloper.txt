About the job
FULLY REMOTE AVAILABLE

We're partnered with a brilliant independent studio in Leamington Spa - they've had two hugely successful mobile games which they're still currently managing. They're currently developing a new, unannounced and original IP and as such the team is growing.

They are looking for a Gameplay Developer. They're a team of around 35, and enjoy a collaborative and really inclusive environment. They also have a very low turnover of staff, and the original four founders are still working in code, art, design and production. They still remain very hands-on.

They use their own engine to develop their titles, so even though they're developing for mobile platforms, they need talented C++ developers.

Regardless of your background, if you have strong C++ skills you can be considered. As they are a small team; each person tends to get involved in various elements of the game. In this role you can expect to be involved in Gameplay, Audio, UI, AI and Audio development.

This is a really creative environment, so if you are a coder who also likes to add ideas on design and game direction, your voice will be heard here.

To be considered for the role, we'd love to see:

Recent, demonstrable game development experience, ideally using C++
You've worked on at least one title from inception to being shipped
Any experience on mobile platforms is welcome
Undeniable passion for games - of all sorts
Good communicator
Able to work under your own initiative and motivation

This is a brilliant role - each time I've recruited for this company the roles have gone fast. You'll enjoy a salary between £40,000 - £55,000 plus a good benefits package.

They'll also help you relocate to Leamington Spa or set up with equipment to work from home.
