About the job
Company Description

Rock and Art â€“ Cultural Outreach UK offers an unorthodox perspective on pop culture and societal issues by an alluring team of divergent creators. Our motley crew of writers, editors, and media developers seek to cover relevant issues and stories through a positionality of authenticity and inclusivity.

Our community of diverse voices offers a refreshing queer feminist perspective to the uneasy truths of life in an exclusionary world.

We propose a conceptual approach that triggers critical thinking and generates debates. It impels social change.

We value culture, enjoy it, analyse and discuss it.

We recognise the intrinsic linkage between pop culture and other social phenomena and stay attentive to it.

We are curious, unapologetic, and loud.

Rock and Art explores topics and engages in analysis often vacant from other media outlets, maintaining feminism and LGBTQ+ identities at the forefront.

We started as a small digital media company based in Argentina. At this stage in our development, we aspire to deliver our message and content to a UK audience. As a growing company, we are joining forces with a variety of local and expert communicators to extend our approach and perspectives.

We are thrilled to share this new chapter with you.
