About the job
BACK END DEVELOPER
Reneum is seeking a back-end developer experienced in content management, AWS, system architecture, and other back-end systems to join their technical development team.

ABOUT RENEUM
Climate change is the number one problem of our generation, and the blockchain is the number one technological innovation of our generation. As a blockchain-based climate platform, Reneum sits at the intersection of our biggest problem and our most important technological innovation.
Reneum is a novel community and marketplace that expands access to all renewable energy to accelerate the energy transition. As a Regenerative Finance (ReFi) platform, Reneum funds climate solutions via a natural capital-backed token and "verified green" NFT. Focusing initially on the energy transition, Reneum partners with green energy developers to vet, monitor and issue tokens they can sell on Reneum's marketplace, for a vertically-integrated approach to ecological credits. Sustainability-focused companies and citizens desiring climate action buy the token to be burnt in return for a collectable NFT representing proof-of-impact (think: LEED or Fair-Trade label, but for the green economy). You can check out our White Paper here for more information on the technical, and see our project Manifesto here to understand our core values.

OUR NEEDS
