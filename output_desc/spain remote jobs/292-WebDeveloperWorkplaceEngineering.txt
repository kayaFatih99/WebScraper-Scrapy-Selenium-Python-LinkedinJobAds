About the job
Canonical is a pioneer in the digital workplace, established in 2004 with a global, remote-first policy that has delivered world class open source and sets the pace in cloud, developer and IoT technology.

We want Canonical to remain the best at remote work. It's part of our enjoyment of our mission - both to deliver the world's best free software, and to push the boundaries of 21st-century work and collaboration. It seems that everyone had a taste of remote work in the past few years, but at Canonical we think it can continue to evolve and improve. We want to take our remote-first workplace to the next level, and are investing in the next wave of tooling to support and streamline our operation.

Our goal is to improve the state of the art even further in key business processes for a distributed team: hiring, collaboration, communication, learning, documentation, development, and open source development. We want to understand our distributed teams as well as we could understand co-located teams. We want to help them work better, be happier, and make better decisions.

Our Workplace Engineering team of web and analytics specialists build new tools, dashboards and analytics that empower colleagues, managers and executives to make better decisions and deliver better work.

Backend web service programming in Python and Node.JS

The ideal candidate will use their passion for experimentation and analytics to build tomorrow’s tech organisation.
