About Sirona Medical

At Sirona Medical we’re building tools for physicians to work as fast as they can think. Many billions of patient images are acquired each year in the U.S., and nearly all of them are reviewed and diagnosed by a radiologist. In fact, 80% of healthcare data flows through radiology IT systems, and radiologists are among healthcare’s most tech-savvy and influential physicians. But they desperately need better, user-friendly software that cuts clicks and optimizes diagnostic time. Sirona is building a modern cloud-native and AI-powered operating system (“RadOS”) that unifies radiology IT onto a single, streamlined workspace. We’re a San Francisco, CA-based software company (with employees working from all over the world) founded on a deep understanding of both the practice and business of radiology.

About The Role

Senior Backend Software Engineers at Sirona are responsible for the data-intensive applications and services we develop for reimagining the way doctors engage with medical images in the era of Computer Vision, NLP and Machine Learning. Software Engineers work in collaboration with our Product Designers, Product Managers and researchers/scientists to solve problems and further the application of technology in the radiology space. Their goal is to help doctors deliver the highest quality of care with the use of technology.
