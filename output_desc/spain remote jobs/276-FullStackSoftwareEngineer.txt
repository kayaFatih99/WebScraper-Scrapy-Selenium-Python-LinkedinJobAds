About the job
Fintecture is a payment infrastructure offering immediate transfer, allowing merchants to collect payments easily.

Launched in 2020, the idea was born out of a simple analysis and yet ignored by all: traditional payments are too complex for merchants and a source of uncertainty for payers.

So, we took a crazy bet: reinventing the payment ecosystem by tackling the technological architecture of payments. Our role is to bring innovative solutions to an industry monopolised by historical players.

We have grown from a team of 7 to over 80 motivated and determined talents to rewrite the history of the payments‚Äô industry. This team has enabled us to sign some fifteen big accounts, ranging from large retail such as Auchan and Leroy Merlin, to business services such as Edenred and Groupe Up, and even tech giants, in just six months.

In 2022, we are raising a total of $29m with the objective of positioning ourselves as the leader of account-to-account payments, doubling our business-volume every two months.

Fintecture, beyond the technology, is a way of looking at the future!

üéØ Missions

We are building a microservice ecosystem of applications serving a multitude of payment and data services for end users. Your role will be to help design, create new, further develop, and maintain existing services in our ecosystem both on the backend and the frontend.

As a Full Stack Software Engineer, you will need to understand the requirements of adding a new service both from a frontend user perspective and a backend architecture perspective. Your tasks will mostly be about creating independent NodeJS microservices interacting with other services by async/sync API calls, message brokers and databases, and further developing our Angular2+ client facing front ends to implement these services.

These services you will create are mostly payments and data processing features which require third party integration. Thus, you will be required to be proficient in reading and writing documentation, writing tests and mocking services, creating schemas and applying API best practices.

We strive on code quality, this means you will have to put an extra effort in code readability, separation of concerns, self-explaining nomenclature, commenting and modularity.

More importantly, we are looking for a passionate person who is ready to go the extra mile, is always looking to improve the existing, and is ambitious to become a key player in a game changing startup.
