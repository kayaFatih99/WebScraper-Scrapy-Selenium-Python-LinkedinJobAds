As a Full Stack Developer, it‚Äôs all about end-to-end ownership! You'll be responsible for designing, developing, and deploying new features and frameworks, focusing on high-performance implementations without neglecting the user experience.

You‚Äôll work in JavaScript/Typescript, using frameworks such as VUE or React on the client side, PHP on the server, and a number of languages, frameworks, and tools in between. You will be responsible for writing clean HTML and CSS. You will work closely with other developers, product designers and product managers in a collaborative and energetic environment.

Here, we iterate quickly and refactor frequently, writing clean and simple code to solve critical business needs ‚Äì and to provide the best possible experience for users. We like to remain curious and open to all technology stacks in order to keep our products innovative.

Responsibilities:
Creating web applications using PHP, PHP Frameworks, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and occasionally other languages.
Architect efficient database schemas for new implementations or improve existing ones.
Working closely with product management and product designers to define user requirements and translating them into reliable, intuitive features.
Evangelizing code quality through writing well-architected, structured code, unit tests, while following best industry practices.
Refactoring, optimizing and constantly driving for improved efficiency and code health.
Implement or customize web interfaces using Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

üèÜ ABOUT YOU
Engineer Degree / Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and 3+ years of relevant work experience in full-stack developments in a SaaS environment with Agile methodologies
