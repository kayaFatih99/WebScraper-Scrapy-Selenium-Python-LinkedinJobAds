About the job
Front is on a mission to make work happier with the first-ever customer communication hub. Relationships are everything in business, but they‚Äôre hard to maintain as a business grows because traits like trust, compassion, and empathy are human qualities that have been difficult for technology to scale. We‚Äôve reimagined the way businesses communicate by bringing customer conversations to the center of one‚Äôs focus. Today, nearly 8,000 businesses have discovered that they can still grow their business and keep the human touch. The world is on course to work happier. We believe our role is to accelerate and shape this path in three ways: the product we make, the culture we live, and the example we set.

With $204M in funding, Front is backed by Sequoia Capital and other leading venture capital firms, as well as independent investors including top executives of Atlassian, Okta, Qualtrics, Zoom, and PagerDuty. Front has received numerous Great Place to Work accolades, including #4 on Fortune‚Äôs Best Workplaces in the Bay Area‚Ñ¢ , Inc. Magazine's 2022 Best Workplaces list , Forbes Best Startup Employers 2022 List , Best workplaces for Millennials 2022 list , and Y Combinator's list of Top Companies in 2022 .

Front is a complex app with high performance requirements: some of our teams involve thousands of users working together in real-time on millions of messages every day. To meet those requirements, we use modern tools like NodeJS, React and TypeScript.

As part of the Insights team, you will be responsible for accelerating the growth of the‚ÄúAnalytics‚Äù feature set of the product. This team serves the managers and decision makers by providing valuable and meaningful learnings to let them excel and scale their business in a competitive environment.

To do so, we develop and integrate a full BI engine to provide valuable insights, that matches the use cases of collaboration and performance, in our simple and intuitive UI inside Front, without the the need for an extra tool.

We are able to hire remotely in France, the UK, Ireland, and Poland.
