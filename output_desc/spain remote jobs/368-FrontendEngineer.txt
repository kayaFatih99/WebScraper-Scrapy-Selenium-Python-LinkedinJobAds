About the job
Who are we?

What does our stack look like?

Our Front-End code is based on Web Components made with Polymer (version 1 and 2) and LitElement. These components are written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS (no preprocessors), keeping the three layers separately (people who write the CSS, they do it in separate CSS files). We use Jest, Web Component Tester, Karma and Cypress for testing our Web Components and systems (currently, we have more than 200 tests).

We also have a custom middleware made with vanilla JavaScript,

You will develop locally on a dockerized environment, with GitHub as code repository and Jenkins as CI pipeline.
