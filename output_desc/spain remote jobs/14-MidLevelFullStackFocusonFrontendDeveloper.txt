About The Geeks & Culture

We are a growing, international indie team that is creating the high-quality, innovative, digital Trading Card Game Synergy of Serra. We believe in the idea that everything in the future is gamified and we start shaping this future today.Next to that, we believe in our values which are the foundation of all beliefs, practices and behaviors that are shared and lived by the entire team. That's why we place special emphasis on enriching our team with more geeks who share the following values with us:
Gamers at heart: We strive to create a world where nobody calls games a waste of time.
Passion: We live our passion, create art and shape our childhood dreams together.
Freedom: Work to your own style, not being bound to location or time, to be the best version of yourself.
Ownership: Own and lead your responsibilities by taking action and making decisions.
Growing together: We support each other to express ourselves and make a difference in the world.
Challenging the status quo: We make disruptive games – never seen before – with creativity and art at their core.

About The Project, Vision & Mission

At Calystral Games we focus on two projects. Synergy of Serra is a digital Trading Card Game utilizing Blockchain technology for the benefit of its players.

With our Marketplace we build the next generation of NFT technology, which puts love for the technology second to the needs of the users.

Our mission is to create fair and trustless, disruptive games and at the same time to transform NFT-financed games to a well accepted and fair type of game that focuses on providing the best free2play gaming experience there can be. That’s how we empower gamers to challenge the status quo and by that unleash their true potential.
