We are a team of 30 awesome talented people based in several countries; that succeeded in making Rebellion the first neobank to offer an ES IBAN and a physical card with Apple Pay and Google Pay.

Offering an awesome current account is not enough, that's why we also built one of the simplest and fastest way to buy and sell cryptocurrencies in the market. Now we are exploring possibilities on DeFi and how personal finance will take advantage of it. It is a great time to build fintech.
