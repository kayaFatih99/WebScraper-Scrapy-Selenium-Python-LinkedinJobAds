About the job
We‚Äôre looking for a Principal Backend Engineer who will bring expertise and strongly impact our technology and development. As someone that cares about outcomes and people, you‚Äôll be the go-to person for helping others and finding the most efficient solutions.

Your deep knowledge in specialisms means you‚Äôll be able to improve our environment and drive success. Our mission is ambitious and underpinned by our Principles (no pun intended). You‚Äôll use the in-depth knowledge of Pento and your technical expertise to impact our platform and partner business strategy with tactical prioritisation decisions.

The role üí¨
You‚Äôll lead and inspire teams to focus on the customer impact and drive excellence at speed. You'll ensure Engineering Managers are focused on the most impactful areas and that work follows best practices and standards, and are able to deliver the desired outcomes quickly with high quality.

Our Principal Engineers will be accountable for the direction of design and architecture. You‚Äôll monitor technical performance across multiple squads and partner with Engineering Managers to mentor and grow the team.

You will raise the bar for our engineering team by creating and evolving chapter-wise best practices, and using your expertise, you‚Äôll be able to anticipate the dependencies and needs of teams, customers and users and develop roadmaps that turn into projects and initiatives across your squads.

Our tech stack ‚öôÔ∏è
We build and host our application and tools using modern and reliable technologies that our team knows and trusts, including React, GraphQL, Golang, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker and Kubernetes.

Our levelling ü™ú
The salary band for this L5 role is ¬£120-135k. Titles and compensation at Pento are dependent on our internal levelling (L1-6), which we'll assess throughout the interview process. We can't guarantee titles and compensation until later in our process once we've assessed competencies, technical skills, and where you land on our frameworks.

Your qualities üíé
You own your impact. You find a way to make things happen, and your word is your bond - when you say something will happen, it happens.
You lead with respect and candour. As an established leader in the community, you‚Äôre recognised for your deep knowledge in your core development specialism. You consistently help other engineers step up and grow whilst being able to find efficient solutions for other people's problems.
You innovate, lead projects and drive change within a business. Through the systems you design and develop, you can deliver business value and high-quality work. You‚Äôre able to balance multiple goals across R&D whilst addressing concerns and turning problems and unclear goals into achievable projects.
You‚Äôre able to advise and impact engineering strategy. With your expert knowledge of at least two core development specialisms and your track record of advising various technical and non-technical stakeholders, you can steer an engineering strategy and work with leadership in urgent situations using your deep understanding of the products and services you‚Äôve worked on.
You communicate intentionally. Your communication brings out the best of others. You can communicate strategy and present your findings company-wide and outside a company. You promote a culture of constructive feedback and praise and are an example that can provide feedback that enables others to develop.
