• Passionate about web development – you are familiar with all aspects of MVC web applications and at ease on server side, applying the most adequate pattern in the right situation.
• Comfortable working across the stack and understanding how all the pieces fit together (front-end, middleware, network layer, etc.) and how they impact the performance of your application.
• Performance and optimisation experience.
• You have interest in working in a very cross-functional team that touches on many of the core systems and user flows.
• A solid engineer – you find something magical about solving problems with elegant but simple solutions. You have deep knowledge of design patterns and are a good problem solver with attention to detail and critical thinking skills.
