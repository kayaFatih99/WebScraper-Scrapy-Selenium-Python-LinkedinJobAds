üöÄ About The Role

You‚Äôll be part of our mobile team, building and maintaining the Android SDK. This library uses specially developed techniques to accurately capture the end user's in-app experience. The Mobile Team's job is to build a stable and solid library that pioneers new ways of understanding the user's journey, so our clients can build and maintain flawless app experiences. You'll ship code used in apps built by the coolest companies on the planet.

You love developing software and digging into apps. Whether you‚Äôre starting your career, or you‚Äôve been engineering for decades, your passion for building with code is palpable. You are particularly fond of Android and high quality apps. Activities, Fragments, lifecycle callbacks and rooted Android devices are your comfort zone. Perhaps you've even dived into Smali or decompiled apps to see how they work. We imagine that you aspire to be more than just a code monkey though. You desire to work closely with other engineers who share your love of development. You see big-picture value in learning from those who have gone before you, and bringing your unique perspective to the team. Also, while you‚Äôre a developer (and possibly an introvert) you actually enjoy brainstorming sessions with your peers and product owners to determine the best approaches forward. You see the importance of providing input and considering the points-of-view of those around you. Basically, you enjoy being a valued member of a healthy team.

üí° Requirements

Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Systems or equivalent.
Self-taught hacker? Perhaps even better.
You are highly proficient with Java, Gradle, Android Studio, and building apps or libraries.
You're also great at tracking down bugs in apps, even if you don't have the source code.
Sure, there are other things you probably know, but these are the technical skills that will prove most valuable in this role.
Special consideration for those who have decompiled apps, built Xposed modules, modified Smali code, debugged network requests with Charles Proxy, or have shipped Android libraries.
You‚Äôre curious, so you‚Äôre probably really familiar with a variety of different tech. This is a good thing because we understand the value of learning continuously and expanding out of your comfort zone.
Compensation: Up to $175,000 per year + bonus potential + equity
