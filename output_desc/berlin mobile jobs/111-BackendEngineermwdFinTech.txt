About the job
Cadeia provides a digital service platform for the structuring, issuance and settlement of complex financial products (e.g. asset-backed securities or syndicated loans but also simple bonds). In addition to enhanced servicing functionalities and a rule-based cash flow distribution solution, the platform also offers reporting, compliance and analytics tools for issuers and investors. At its core, a blockchain-agnostic Smart Contract Engine (SCE) allows for the automated execution of legal contracts, transactions, and payments.

After a successful seed round and a recently approved public funding, we are solidly financed.
