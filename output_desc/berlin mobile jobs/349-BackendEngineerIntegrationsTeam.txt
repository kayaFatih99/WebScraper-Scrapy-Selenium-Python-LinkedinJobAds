About the job
We are looking for a Backend Engineer specializing in Ruby, Go, and 3rd Party Integrations to join our Integrations Team. We are currently a team of 5 backend developers working in 5-week-long iterations (inspired by “Shape Up”) to develop and maintain the billing system integrations that provide raw data to the heart of the ChartMogul platform. As an engineer on the Integrations team, you will have the opportunity to refine and improve on our existing interactions with major billing services such as Stripe and PayPal, as well as build new integrations with additional services that are on our roadmap. Because of our 5-week cycle structure, you’ll also have lots of opportunities to take ownership over a given feature or project, organize your own work, and see things through to completion.

Responsibilities:
Learn, understand, and use 3rd-party APIs efficiently to extract data from different billing services
Collaborate on tackling problems and designing optimal solutions, not just implementing someone else’s design
Investigate complex data to pinpoint precision issues and help improve customer trust in the product
Create and maintain a reliable, developer-friendly test suite, and explain meaning through documentation
Contribute to the quality of our codebase by reviewing pull requests and provide constructive feedback
Look for new tools and strategies to optimize bottlenecks in our architecture
