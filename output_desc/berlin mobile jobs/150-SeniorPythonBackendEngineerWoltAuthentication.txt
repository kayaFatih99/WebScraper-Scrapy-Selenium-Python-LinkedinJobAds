Job Description

We are looking for an experienced Python Backend Engineer to join our growing Platform Services team! This team helps other Wolt Product teams to succeed - we embrace a customer-first mindset for creating tools, services, and sharing knowledge, in the domains of authentication and authorization and event-driven architecture.
In the Platform Services team, you get to work at the center of the action, with a talented and diverse group of people and use the latest technologies to resolve platform-wide problems in the pursuit of high-quality services that are secure, and scalable.
In this position you'll be developing the Wolt Authentication component weâ€™ve built from scratch, ensuring its security, reliability, and scalability, as the number of users grows rapidly. Itâ€™s a central role in the organization, so youâ€™ll work with multiple teams to secure our consumer applications, internal tools, as well as communication within our systems. You will be developing systems and libraries that are used across the platform, and you can have a big impact on the future development of these solutions.

If you didn't know it yet, we have a strong Python community at Wolt: around 100 of our engineers are actively using Python and sharing knowledge related to its rich ecosystem. Wolt Tech Talks Youtube channel has recordings from our Python meetups and the Python-related blog posts in our engineering blog

Our humble expectations

ðŸ‘‰ You might be the one if you are an engineer with experience in designing and building top-class software and APIs with modern Python. We mostly work with Flask & FastAPI, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and appreciate it if you understand what it takes to build and operate scalable software services in production. Our massive backend is powered with Kubernetes in AWS so proficiency in these platforms or similar and cloud infrastructure is a huge plus. Experience with Go, Java, and related languages is seen as beneficial, and we also value previous front-end development exposure.
ðŸ‘‰ You know what it takes to achieve ambitious goals together. We expect you to be a good communicator, willing to collaborate with people outside of your own team, be a product-oriented and proactive problem solver willing to bring up issues in a constructive manner to the team and the Wolt Product team at large.
ðŸ‘‰ Understanding of security concerns in web applications such as SSO, Oauth, OpenID Connect, IAM, JWT, HTTP, and REST will also be a big plus, but don't let it get into your way if these are newer things for you, we are sure you'll get the grasp of them!

Next Steps

The position will be filled as soon as we find the right person, so make sure to apply as soon as you realize you really, really want to join us!
The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and DoorDash RSUs. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as youâ€™ll own a piece of the pie.
