About the job
Welcome to byways ðŸš›!

We are a Berlin based startup on our way to revolutionize logistics & supply chain. Did you know, that fax machines are still a thing in logistics?

Let's do something about it - together.

Tasks

Our SaaS solution is aiming to replace pen & paper, fax machines, and unnecessary phone calls & emails from the daily work of logistics experts. For that, we have built a solution based on React, NodeJS, NestJS, RabbitMQ, and various database models.

Your task would be to work on the core product. That comes with implementing the backend side for new endpoints (based on NestJS), working on the visualization and logic on the frontend (based on React), maintaining the code base, and working with the team to conceptualize, design, and implement future software architecture expansions. Of course, the exact focus area depends on your skillset and preferences (e.g. frontend vs. backend tasks).

So pretty much - you work with all of us together on building the best software environment to improve the life of warehouse workers and carriers all over the globe.
