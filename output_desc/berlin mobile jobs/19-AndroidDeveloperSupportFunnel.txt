Job Description

Wolt is in a phase of rapid growth and we have been expanding from servicing restaurant food delivery to other delivery markets as well, which means that our Android application also needs to adapt and evolve to meet these new needs. And to make this possible, we are now looking for some reinforcements! So, if you‚Äôre an Android developer with fresh ideas who would like to join us in building the future, then read on! üöÄ

World-class customer service is one of the critical cornerstones of Wolt üíô The quality of communication between our team and our customers and partners is essential as it determines how fast and accurately we can respond to inquiries and solve emerging problems. At Wolt we currently serve over 15 million registered customers üåç. Since it takes some real serious work from our dedicated customer support teams in each of the 23 countries to ensure customer satisfaction we‚Äôre always on the lookout for ways to make their work more convenient and the customer experience even smoother.

The team will own the Wolt support funnel end-to-end: it will take ownership of adding self-service features our customers can use to automate changes without support involvement, automatisation, and improving support associate ticket handling efficiency. Also, you‚Äôll be working together with our amazing team of mobile developers on our world class consumer app and joining in reviewing contributions. Since the team is in a building phase, you would be one of the critical persons for developing the support tools' future, which is quite exciting really!

For this role you can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Berlin, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and Estonia now and in the future! Read more about our remote set-up here.

Our humble expectations

In order to succeed in the role, you‚Äôll need several years of experience building apps using modern Android technologies, our choice of language is Kotlin. Since the self-service tool will be built from scratch, we are looking for someone who has excellent communication skills and who, ideally, has some experience working in a large end to end feature team.

On top of that, we value an attitude of constant improvement and also the ability to create things from scratch. An entrepreneurial mindset of taking ownership of what you've built is a must.

So, if you feel that you‚Äôve got what it takes and if working on a cool product in a cool team sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in doing, we‚Äôd love to hear from you! üíô
