Job Description

Wolt is building a new team with a mission to provide effective tools for managing the practicalities of courier employment. In countries like Germany, Wolt couriers are in an employment relationship with Wolt. Being able to effectively manage things like absences and working hours has a big impact on the courier experience and efficiency of the delivery platform.
This is a greenfield project, so you’ll be building a beautiful product from the ground up and integrating it with external systems, like HR and payroll. Kotlin and Scala will be the main backend programming languages of the team, while frontends are built in React/TypeScript. Wolt has a strong community around Kotlin/Scala/React, so there are good opportunities to collaborate and learn from others.
As a first developer in the team, you’ll have a huge impact on shaping the vision and the structure of the team. You’ll be driving the development of top-quality software in cooperation with a Product Lead, designers and a wider Product team at Wolt.
📍This role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Berlin, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here.

Our humble expectations

👉 You have solid experience designing, building and integrating quality software in Kotlin and Scala on a large scale within a complex domain.
👉 You have strong technical leadership skills.
You have knowledge of Kubernetes, observability (Data Dog or similar tools) and data storages.
👉 Your stakeholder management skills are excellent.
👉 You’re a dedicated person who is pragmatic with a positive attitude, who doesn't shy away from going outside of their comfort zone, and demonstrates curiosity and willingness to keep continuously learning.

Next Steps

💯 Overall our product organization consists of a team of over 400 people at Wolt. We aim to build none other than the best-in-the-world engineering team here.
💙 You’ll get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognise that if we don’t learn, we won’t stay still but fall behind, and keep in mind that Luke was Yoda’s greatest achievement.
🙌 Join us for an exciting journey! The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and equity. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you'll own a piece of the pie.

About Wolt

Wolt is a technology company that makes it incredibly easy to discover and get the best restaurants, grocery stores and other local shops delivered to your home or office. Wolt is not just a delivery app – we’re a technology company building a commerce platform to seamlessly connect our millions of customers with thousands of merchant and courier partners, in real-time across 23 countries and 250+ cities. Our apps (iOS and Android) have the industry’s highest ratings, largely thanks to our customer-first-mindset, which shows in how we build products and run operations. In June 2022 we officially joined forces with DoorDash. Combined, we have a presence in 27 countries, 23 of which operate with the Wolt brand and app. Wolt and DoorDash continue largely independently, with Wolt’s name, brand, product, technology and team.

Each team takes ownership for solving customer problems in the best possible way.
Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
We want to have all sorts of people in our team – people like you and me, and people different from you and me. To be able to work with diverse teammates – when it comes to gender, age, ethnicity, life background, sexual orientation, political views, religion, or any other personal trait – we consciously aim to offer equal opportunity for everyone to work with us. This is because we believe diverse teams make the most thought-through decisions and build things in the most inclusive way.
