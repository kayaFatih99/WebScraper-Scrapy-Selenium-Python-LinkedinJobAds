Job Description

At the fast growing scale of the Wolt business our operational efficiency benefits greatly from having automation for managing supply (how many courier partners are online) and demand (how many orders are being placed by customers). For us itâ€™s a clear win-win situation, but it takes an entire team to make sure that this is possible. ðŸ’ª So, in order to achieve our mission to build the best tools for keeping the fine balance between planning and forecasting of delivery services at any given time and place, we decided to strengthen our ranks by adding one more Backend Engineer to our new Supply and Demand Forecasting team to balance out our own team needs!
You will be working with a frontend engineer, UX designers, backend engineers, and data scientists, and right now weâ€™re building our supply and demand forecasting systems of the future, but we need your help in doing so! So, if youâ€™re an experienced backend engineer with an interest in tackling scalability challenges and building some real cool stuff, then be sure to drop us a line. ðŸ’Œ At the moment our backend is built using Python and Scala, so knowing these languages or having the interest in learning them would be required. Also, youâ€™ll get a chance to work closely together with our brilliant Data Scientists (seriously, this is a great chance to learn a lot about data science if you have a knack for it)!
Still not sure? As a backend engineer, you will have a big impact on the team and you will be a key player in building a new platform that will help us create reliable forecasts which consume large amounts of operator sourced data where operators can input and alter planning data and can trigger model runs based on their inputs. Youâ€™ll also work on designing and implementing APIs, helping data scientists integrate their new ML-based models, as well as setting up data pipelines between our backend and data warehouse, so thereâ€™s quite a lot of exciting stuff going on!
Lastly, this role can be based in one of our tech hubs in Helsinki or Berlin, or you can work remotely anywhere in Finland, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, and Estonia. Read more about our remote setup here.

Our humble expectations

Previous experience or willingness to tinker in the backend with Scala and/or Python
Experience in setting up backend microservices
Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration
Familiarity with database technologies, such as PostgreSQL
Several years of experience building production-grade software
Analytical and curious thinking, self-starter with drive to get things done
Comfortable working with real-world data and its different nuances
In addition to technical skills, we are looking for dedicated people who aim to write modern, testable and maintainable code, are pragmatic with a positive attitude, donâ€™t shy away from going outside of their tech comfort zone, and demonstrate curiosity and willingness to keep continuously learning.

Next Steps

ðŸ’¯ Overall our product organization consists of a team of over 400 people at Wolt. We aim to build none other than the best-in-the-world engineering team here.
ðŸ’™ Youâ€™ll get to work in a company culture where we take ownership beyond the obvious, do common things uncommonly well, we think big but stay humble, do right by people, we treat others kindly and justly, recognise that if we donâ€™t learn, we wonâ€™t stay still but fall behind, and keep in mind that Luke was Yodaâ€™s greatest achievement.
ðŸ™Œ Join us for an exciting journey! The compensation will be a negotiable combination of monthly pay and equity. The latter makes it exceptionally easy to be excited about our company growing and doing well, as you'll own a piece of the pie.
